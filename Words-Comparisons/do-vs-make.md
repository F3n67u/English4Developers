## Do VS Make

### What is the difference between "do" and "make"?

When people use **‘do’** and ‘**make’** with noun phrases, **‘do’** focuses on the process of acting or performing something, while ‘**make’ emphasises** more the product or outcome of an action.

Peter **made** me some coffee while Jane was **doing** homework this morning.

Mum is **making** me a coffee while Jane is **doing** homework.

**Make** focuses on result or outcome, in our examples, the result is a coffee was made.

**Do** on the other hand, focuses on the action, Jane is/was in the process of **doing** homework**.**
