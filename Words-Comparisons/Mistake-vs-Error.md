## Mistake VS Error

#### What is the difference between "mistake" and "error"?

The difference between  ***'error'*** and '***mistake***' is in the context that they are used in.

A '***mistake*'** is usually accidental, you know it is wrong. Otherwise, an '***error***' **** is usually made due to the lack of knowledge and is more formal than 'mistake'.

**Mistakes** are an accident. You know it's wrong, but the wrong word slips out.

In developer’s perspective, when code produces wrong results, we cannot say the code made a **mistake**. It’s more likely that  **a logical error** in the developer’s mind that leads to the wrong result.

An **error**, on the other hand, is something you don't know. It can be a grammar point you haven't learned yet or vocabulary you haven't learned the nuance of yet.

Errors are interesting because it gives you a chance to learn something for the first time.

"Machines never make **mistakes**, but rather they make **errors**. People can make both."
