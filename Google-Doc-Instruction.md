### FYI (stands for 'FOR YOUR INFORMATION'):

Some students **asked** us why we use **Google Doc** and **Gmail**, rather than other tools, such as Microsoft Office 365 and other free tools.

One of the most important reasons is that for **remote jobs** you are going to apply, the prospect employer tends to use a suite from Google to **Save money**. Especially for smaller companies. Microsoft Office costs are **too high** for small players.

Another reason is that, once you have Google credentials from services such as Gmail, you can log in to other services such as LinkedIn with the Google account, which will **save time** and make your life a lot easier.

We want our students to be equipped as much as possible to gain some **REAL Working Experience** as a remote worker.

If you have any questions, feel free to post them on the WeChat group, and we will guide you along the way.

## 1. Get an Gmail Account

Go to http://www.gmail.com to register a gmail account if you don’t have one already.

First change the permission to Editor, then click on Copy the link.
