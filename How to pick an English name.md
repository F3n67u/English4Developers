# How to pick an English name? 

#### *Is it extremely necessary for me to possess an English name?*

#### *What is the drawback to use my very own name?*

#### *Why do many individuals value more highly to call themselves in their English name?*

All are fair questions. In this article, I try to answer the question of whether we should have an English name or if there's a much better way to have one.

### *Is it necessary for me to get an English name?*

The **short answer** is ‘no’. 

The long answer is that **it depends**. 

The name that your parents named you at birth is **more** than just your qualifications and skills. It contains wishes or hopes that parents have in mind. It may have special meanings to it. In an English-speaking country, it's fine to introduce yourself with your own name.

### *Why pick an English name then?*

There are many reasons why people get an English name. They include:

1. It's feared that native English speakers may have trouble pronouncing their names.

2. Having an English name is regarded as a sign of education in the learner's country.

3. It is believed that a new name in the second language can help build a cultural identity.

***Reason 1*** is probably the most common reason. It's possible that English speakers have difficulty pronouncing your name correctly. You need to accept the fact that some people whom you haven't met before may pronounce it wrong. Or worst, they just never get it right in some rare cases. However, in most cases, if you take the time to say your name slowly and clearly, one sound at a time, most speakers will be able to pronounce it quite well.

Younger English learners living in their home country are more likely to have ***reason 2***. It doesn't matter for those who are already living abroad and have nothing to do with learning English. They just think having an English name is cool.

***Reason 3*** is the most valuable reason for English learners in my opinion. For many people, language learning is more than just learning new sets of new words. Cultural behavior, habits and attitudes are included in acquiring the language. Those who have a sense of personal identity are the most likely to be a successful language learner. Everyone has a natural process of moving their tongue, jaw, and mouth. It was built over time while speaking their native language. Learners who show a better ability to adapt to foreign sounds’ mouth positions are more likely to produce the sounds naturally.

The use of gestures is an example of something I have experienced. I began to say* 'Maya'（’妈呀’）*at times of frustration or surprise. With this, there was a breath of air out, an eyeball rolling and waving of arms.

These **cultural** and **spoken behaviors** take a learner into a foreign place that sound try to express. It is a part of the language that could only be learnt via **experiences**. It is *invisible* part of a language. People who are better able to deal with this kind of pain are more likely to become better communicators across different cultures.

### *Is it possible to become a fluent English speaker without using an English name?*

Absolutely. 

However, through experiences and observations, learners who are taking on a new name can be liberating for language learners and may help them achieve their goals *faster*. It is a part of identity building. If you want to have an English name, keep reading to find out how to pick a proper one for yourself.

### *How NOT to pick an English name?*

You should assume that you will keep this name for the rest of your life. YES, for life and it becomes a part of your identity once you decide. So, you should take care to pick one that you like the sound or meaning, and check that it is culturally acceptable to the English-speaking country.

Here are three groups of English names that I **DON’T** recommend:

- Group 1 - Scissors, Stone, Easy, Vascular
- Group 2 - Smog, Wintel
- Group 3 - Chandler, Hermione, Kobe, Daenerys/Khaleesi

Let's look at each group and why I ***DON’T*** recommend them.

**Group 1** are words from the English language that aren't used for a person’s name in English-speaking countries. These examples were often chosen by Chinese students because of the similarity between the English words and their own Chinese names.

- 'Scissors' and 'Stone' are everyday objects and are not used as English names
- 'Vascular’ was chosen because it is related to the student's profession. It is a word from Heart surgery.
- 'Easy' is not an English name and it has the implication that the person is available for sex at will. Which is inappropriate in most of the English-Speaking cultures. 

While **Chinese names** are usually chosen from common words in the Chinese language, English first names are usually picked from **a list of traditional names** based on their *sound, meaning or memory of a loved one.*

Picking a different name that ***ignores*** the cultural background of the second language, which can cause **embarrassment**, **surprise**, or even **offense**.

**Group 2** names were created by combining two English words:

- smog = smoke + fog
- Wintel = Windows + Intel

This is ***NOT*** a conventional way of picking a name in English, because they are creative names and may help describe the person's interests or background. However, if an interviewer **feels** that you haven't taken the time of choosing a name ***seriously***, then they might question your **ability** to take work ***seriously***. We want to have a name that **helps** not *hurts* when we apply for remote positions, right?

**Group 3** contains the names of famous and fictional people. These names are rare, which makes them easy to remember. Can you recall Chandler from Friends? 

If you want to choose a name like this, be aware that many native speakers will know where the name comes from when you introduce yourself. It is possible that your name will bring up memories of people you meet. These can be good or bad. It is outside your control, which is not good for job seeking in my opinion. The chance is 50/50, take it at your own risk. 

Many native English speakers name their children after **famous** people, so you might not think that is a bad thing. However, there is a difference. Now, you are naming yourself, not naming your kid. You can ***clearly*** tell people if you feel the same way about this name you pick.

## How to pick an right English name?

‘When in Rome, do as the Romans do’. (入乡随俗in Chinese)

### *How do English-Speaking parents pick the names of their children?*

A person’s name contains a '**first name**' and a‘**surname(Last Name)**'. Anything between the first name and surname is called the middle name(s). In most cases, only the first name and sometimes a ‘middle name' is chosen by parents for their child. Like Chinese culture, the last name or surname has a legacy attached to the family tree. Last name changes are very rare.

Parents usually pick up a book of baby names to research their meanings. They will often say the name next to the surname to make sure it sounds right. They might prefer a name that begins with a specific letter. Some parents prefer a more special name for their child, while others prefer a more common one.

English names go in and out of fashion as time goes on. This affects the way an adult chooses their English name. Below are some steps to find an English name.

Step 1: Go this this great Baby Name finder:

1. https://www.babycenter.com/baby-names
2. https://www.mamanatural.com/baby-names/ 

Both are name finders I found useful. They allow you to search for names by gender, origin, meaning or first letter. Babycenter.com even has name categories your can “Browser by theme”. If you’re looking for something more ‘old-fashioned’, ‘classic’, ‘gender-neutral’ or ‘alternatives to popular names’. Give it a try.

Step 2: Make a list of names that you like. Do they sound good before your last name?

Step 3: Before you make a decision, ask the English teacher or native English speaker for their opinion. They should be able to tell you how to pronounce it and if it sounds good next to your last name.

Step 4: Use your new English name with pride whenever you have English conversations and experiment with your new cultural identity.

That’s it. I hope it helps.

Have fun!
